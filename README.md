# FaceDetection in C++

## *NOTE:*
#### OpenCV needs to be installed and added to the system's environment path. A x64 debugger is needed to compile the code and only works in 64-bit systems.
#### Using Visual Studio 2022 with C++ desktop development package is recommended.

## *What it does?*
- Detects the faces appering in the webcam.
- Draws a rectangle around the detected faces.
- Displays the number of faces detected in the frame.
- Randomly picks text color and rectangle color in every webcam startup.
- Warms-up the webcam before the detection to ensure smooth real-time detection.
- The compiled EXE file can be shared and used in different 64-bit PCs.
